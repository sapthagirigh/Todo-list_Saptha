To-Do List by Sapthagiri. D

This is a simple and clean To-Do List web app made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes both light and dark mode themes, task filtering, task priority tags (like High, Moderate, Low), and it saves your tasks using your browser’s local storage — so they’re still there even if you refresh or close the tab.

Features:

You can mark tasks as completed or undo them.

Filter your tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete.

Toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

Each task shows its priority: High, Moderate, or Low.

Your tasks are saved in local storage automatically.
